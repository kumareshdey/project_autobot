# Streamlit Chat App with Langchain and Ollama

This project is a chat-based application built using Streamlit, Langchain, and Ollama's models. It allows users to engage in a chat with two different characters: Spiderman and Batman, both modeled as funny conversational AI agents using large language models.

Please don't judge the code quality of this project. It was created as a fun personal project to explore the capabilities of large language models.
